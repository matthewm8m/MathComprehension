The angles in the triangles below that have the same label $\theta$ or $\varphi$ are equal. Solve for $x$. \\
\[\]
We need one of the missing sides. The hypotenuse on the left is $\sqrt{13}$.
The triangles are similar so we set up ratios.
$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{x+1}{7} &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\
  x+1 &= \frac{21}{\sqrt{13}} \\
  x &= \frac{21}{\sqrt{13}} - 1
\end{align*}
$$
