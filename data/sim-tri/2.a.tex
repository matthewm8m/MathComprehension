The angles in the triangles below that have the same label $\alpha$, $\beta$, or $\gamma$ are equal. Solve for $x$.
\[\]
The triangles are similar so we set up ratios.
$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{x} &= \frac{x-2}{3} \\
  3 &= x(x-2) \\
  0 &= x^2 - 2x - 3 \\
  0 &= (x - 3)(x + 1) \\
  3, -1 &= x
\end{align*}
$$

But both $x$ and $x - 2$ must be positive, so $x = 3$.
