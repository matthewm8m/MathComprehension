There is a pirate ship sailing across a small channel (assume stationary water). The channel is $300$m across. A pirate in the crow's nest spots the shore they departed from with a $50^{\circ}$ angle of depression. They spot the shore they are arriving at with a $40^{\circ}$ angle of depression. How far (in m) are they along the channel?
