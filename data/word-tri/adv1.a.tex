There is a pirate ship sailing across a small channel (assume stationary water). The channel is $300$m across. A pirate in the crow's nest spots the shore they departed from with a $50^{\circ}$ angle of depression. They spot the shore they are arriving at with a $40^{\circ}$ angle of depression. How far (in m) are they along the channel?
\[\]
Considering the picture below, we have
$$
\cot(50^{\circ}) = \frac{x_1}{h} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cot(40^{\circ}) = \frac{x_2}{h}
$$
Also $x_1 + x_2 = 300\ \text{m}$. Adding the fractions gives
$$
\cot(50^{\circ}) + \cot(40^{\circ}) = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{h} = \frac{300\ \text{m}}{h}
$$
so
$$
h = \frac{300\ \text{m}}{\cot(50^{\circ}) + \cot(40^{\circ})}.
$$
Plugging into $\cot(50^{\circ}) = \frac{x_1}{h}$, we get
$$
  \cot(50^{\circ}) = \frac{x_1(\cot(50^{\circ}) + \cot(40^{\circ}))}{300\ \text{m}}
$$
so
$$
  x_1 = 300\ \text{m} \cdot \frac{cot(50^{\circ})}{\cot(50^{\circ}) + \cot(40^{\circ})}.
$$
