Two friends are on opposite sides of a street holding a rope. The street is $20$ ft across and one of the friends estimates the angle formed by the rope and the sidewalk is $10^{\circ}$. What is the distance (in ft) between the friends?

Look at the picture below. The relationship is $\csc(10^{\circ}) = d / (20\ \text{ft})$ so $d = 20\csc(10^{\circ})\ \text{ft}$.
