There are a pair of drones hovering over some flat ground. Drone $A$ is higher and is directly above ground point $A$. Drone $B$ is lower and is directly above ground point $B$. From drone $A$, we can see drone $B$ with $30^{\circ}$ angle of depression. From drone $B$, we can see point $A$ with a $70^{\circ}$ angle of depression. Points $A$ and $B$ are $30$ft apart. How high (in ft) are drones $A$ and $B$ off the ground? Also, what distance apart are they?
\[\]
Label a picture as below. The angle $\alpha$ satisfies the equation $\tan(\alpha) = 20ft / 25ft$ so $\alpha = \tan^{-1}(20/25)$. The angle $\beta$ satisfies the equation $\tan(\beta) = 50ft / 25ft$ so $\beta = \tan^{-1}(50/25)$. The difference of the angles is
\[
  \beta - \alpha = \tan^{-1}(50/25) - \tan^{-1}(20/25).
