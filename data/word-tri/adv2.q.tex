There are a pair of drones hovering over some flat ground. Drone $A$ is higher and is directly above ground point $A$. Drone $B$ is lower and is directly above ground point $B$. From drone $A$, we can see drone $B$ with $30^{\circ}$ angle of depression. From drone $B$, we can see point $A$ with a $70^{\circ}$ angle of depression. Points $A$ and $B$ are $30$ft apart. How high (in ft) are drones $A$ and $B$ off the ground? Also, what distance apart are they?
