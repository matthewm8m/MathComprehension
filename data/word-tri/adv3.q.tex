A secret agent on the ground is fighting aliens in a building. The agent is $25$ft from the building. There are two aliens: the first is $20$ft high, the second is on top of the $50$ft building. The agent has a laser pointed at the first alien. How much does the laser need to be adjusted (as an angle) to hit the second alien?
