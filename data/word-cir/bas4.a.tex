A person is running on an elliptical machine at $5$ mph. The pedals on the machine rotate on a disk with radius $2$ ft. How many ${}^{\circ} /\ \text{s}$ are the elliptical pedals rotating?
\[\]
The linear speed here is $v = 5\ \text{mph}$. The radius is $2\ \text{ft}$. To convert between linear and angular speeds, we use $v = r\omega$. So
$$
  \omega = \frac{5\ \text{mi} / \text{hr}}{2\ \text{ft}} \cdot \frac{5280\ \text{ft}}{1\ \text{mi}} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{hr}}{60\ \text{mins}} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{min}}{60\ \text{s}} \cdot \frac{180^{\circ}}{1\ \text{rad}}.
$$
Simplifying gives
$$
  \omega = 660^{\circ}/\text{s}.
$$
