A tire has a diameter of $16$ in. There is a rock lodged in the circumference of the tire. In $1$ second, the tire rotates $\frac{\pi}{12}$ radians. How far (in in.) does the rock travel in $1$ minute?
\[\]
The radius is $r = 8$ in. Doing a conversion factor calculation gives
$$
1\ \text{min} \cdot \frac{60\ \text{s}}{1\ \text{min}} \cdot \frac{\pi/12\ \text{rad}}{1\ \text{s}} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{rev}}{2\pi\ \text{rad}} \cdot \frac{c = 2\pi r}{1\ \text{rev}} = 40\pi\ \text{in}
$$
Or using $s = r\theta$ with $\theta = \omega t$ gives the same
$$
  s = 8\ \text{in} \cdot (\frac{\frac{\pi}{12}}{1\ \text{s}} \cdot \frac{60\ \text{s}}{1\ \text{min}}) = 40\pi\ \text{in}.
$$
