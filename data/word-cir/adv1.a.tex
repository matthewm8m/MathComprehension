Suppose a sprinkler sprays water perfectly evenly over a sector of a circle with central angle $50^{\circ}$. Exactly $48\ \text{in}^2$ worth of water is used. How far (in in.) does the sprinkler spray?
\[\]
The area of a sector is $A = \pi r^2 \frac{\theta^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}}$ where $\theta^{\circ} = 50^{\circ}$ and $A = 48\ \text{in}^2$ here. We need to solve for the radius $r$. We get
$$
  r^2 = \frac{48\ \text{in}^2}{\pi} \cdot \frac{360^{\circ}}{50^{\circ}} \qquad \text{so} \qquad r = +\sqrt{\frac{48 \cdot 360}{\pi \cdot 50}}\ \text{in}.
$$
Simplifying slightly gives
$$
  r = +\sqrt{\frac{1728}{5\pi}}\ \text{in}.
$$
