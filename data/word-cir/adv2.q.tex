Suppose that a circle of radius $5$ units is rotating at $\frac{1}{12}\pi$ radians per second. There is a particle on the circumference of the circle. The circle rotates for $7$ seconds and the particle is released tangentially to the circle. 1) Find the angle $\theta$ at which the particle is released. 2) Find the linear speed $v$ (in units/s) of the particle upon release. 3) Use these to find the components $x$ and $y$ (in units/s).
