Suppose that a circle of radius $5$ units is rotating at $\frac{1}{12}\pi$ radians per second. There is a particle on the circumference of the circle. The circle rotates for $8$ seconds and the particle is released tangentially to the circle. 1) Find the angle $\theta$ at which the particle is released. 2) Find the linear speed $v$ (in units/s) of the particle upon release. 3) Use these to find the components $x$ and $y$ (in units/s). Make sure to use $+$ or $-$ when applicable.

1)
$$
\theta = \frac{1}{12}\pi\ \text{rad}/\text{s} \cdot 8\ \text{s} = \frac{8}{12}\pi = \frac{2}{3}\pi.
$$
2) The linear speed is given by $v = r\omega$ so
$$
  v = \frac{1}{12}\pi \cdot 5\ \text{u} = \frac{5}{12}\pi\ \text{u}.
$$
3) We can use trigonometry in the coordinate plane to get
$$
  \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\pi + \theta\right) = \frac{y}{v} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\pi + \theta\right) = \frac{x}{v}
$$
Then solving gives us, we have
$$
  y = v\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\pi + \theta\right) \qquad \text{and} \qquad x = v\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\pi + \theta\right)
$$
Notice that $\frac{1}{2}\pi + \theta = \frac{7}{6}\pi$. This is in quadrant $III$ and has reference angle $\frac{1}{6}\pi$. Then plugging everything in, we get
$$
  x = -\frac{5}{12}\pi \cos\left(\frac{1}{6}\pi\right) = -\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{24}\pi \qquad \text{and} \qquad y = -\frac{5}{12}\pi \sin\left(\frac{1}{6}\pi\right) = \frac{5\sqrt{1}}{12}\pi.
$$
