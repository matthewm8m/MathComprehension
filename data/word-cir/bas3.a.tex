A watermelon is rolling down a hill along its widest circumference at a rate of $20^{\circ} /\ \text{s}$. How many rpm is the watermelon rolling at?
\[\]
All measurements are angular so this is just a conversion problem. Using conversion factors:
$$
\omega = \frac{20^{\circ}}{1\ \text{s}} \cdot \frac{60\ \text{s}}{1\ \text{min}} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{rev}}{360^{\circ}} = \frac{10}{3}\ \text{rpm}.
$$
