A circular, rainbow pinwheel has $5$ equally-sized sectors with distinct colors. The pinwheel has a radius of $10$ cm. How much area (in $\text{cm}^2$) does each color on the pinwheel occupy?
\[\]
Using that the total area of the pinwheel is $A = \pi r^2 = 100\pi\ \text{cm}^2$ and splitting into fifths gives $A' = 20\pi\ \text{cm}^2$. Alternatively, use the angle $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{5}$ and input into $A = \frac{1}{2} \theta r^2$ to get
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \frac{2\pi}{5} (10\ \text{cm})^2 = 20\pi\ \text{cm}^2
$$
